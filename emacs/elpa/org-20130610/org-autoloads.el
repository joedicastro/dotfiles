Outline-based notes management and organizer, alias
\"Carsten's outline-mode for keeping track of everything.\"

Org-mode develops organizational tasks around a NOTES file which
contains information about projects as plain text.  Org-mode is
implemented on top of outline-mode, which is ideal to keep the content
of large files well structured.  It supports ToDo items, deadlines and
time stamps, which magically appear in the diary listing of the Emacs
calendar.  Tables are easily created with a built-in table editor.
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails (VM), Usenet
messages (Gnus), BBDB entries, and any files related to the project.
For printing and sharing of notes, an Org-mode file (or a part of it)
can be exported as a structured ASCII or HTML file.

(autoload 'org-cycle "org" "\
TAB-action and visibility cycling for Org-mode.

This is the command invoked in Org-mode by the TAB key.  Its main purpose
is outline visibility cycling, but it also invokes other actions
in special contexts.

- When this function is called with a prefix argument, rotate the entire
  buffer through 3 states (global cycling)
  1. OVERVIEW: Show only top-level headlines.
  2. CONTENTS: Show all headlines of all levels, but no body text.
  3. SHOW ALL: Show everything.
  When called with two `C-u C-u' prefixes, switch to the startup visibility,
  determined by the variable `org-startup-folded', and by any VISIBILITY
  properties in the buffer.
  When called with three `C-u C-u C-u' prefixed, show the entire buffer,
  including any drawers.

- When inside a table, re-align the table and move to the next field.

- When point is at the beginning of a headline, rotate the subtree started
  by this line through 3 different states (local cycling)
  1. FOLDED:   Only the main headline is shown.
  2. CHILDREN: The main headline and the direct children are shown.
               From this state, you can move to one of the children
               and zoom in further.
  3. SUBTREE:  Show the entire subtree, including body text.
  If there is no subtree, switch directly from CHILDREN to FOLDED.

- When point is at the beginning of an empty headline and the variable
  `org-cycle-level-after-item/entry-creation' is set, cycle the level
  of the headline by demoting and promoting it to likely levels.  This
  speeds up creation document structure by pressing TAB once or several
  times right after creating a new headline.

- When there is a numeric prefix, go up to a heading with level ARG, do
  a `show-subtree' and return to the previous cursor position.  If ARG
  is negative, go up that many levels.

- When point is not at the beginning of a headline, execute the global
  binding for TAB, which is re-indenting the line.  See the option
  `org-cycle-emulate-tab' for details.

- Special case: if point is at the beginning of the buffer and there is
  no headline in line 1, this function will act as if called with prefix arg
  (C-u TAB, same as S-TAB) also when called without prefix arg.

(autoload 'org-search-view "org-agenda" "\
Show all entries that contain a phrase or words or regular expressions.

With optional prefix argument TODO-ONLY, only consider entries that are
TODO entries.  The argument STRING can be used to pass a default search
string into this function.  If EDIT-AT is non-nil, it means that the
user should get a chance to edit this string, with cursor at position
EDIT-AT.

The search string can be viewed either as a phrase that should be found as
is, or it can be broken into a number of snippets, each of which must match
in a Boolean way to select an entry.  The default depends on the variable
`org-agenda-search-view-always-boolean'.
Even if this is turned off (the default) you can always switch to
Boolean search dynamically by preceding the first word with  \"+\" or \"-\".

The default is a direct search of the whole phrase, where each space in
the search string can expand to an arbitrary amount of whitespace,
including newlines.

If using a Boolean search, the search string is split on whitespace and
each snippet is searched separately, with logical AND to select an entry.
Words prefixed with a minus must *not* occur in the entry.  Words without
a prefix or prefixed with a plus must occur in the entry.  Matching is
case-insensitive.  Words are enclosed by word delimiters (i.e. they must
match whole words, not parts of a word) if
`org-agenda-search-view-force-full-words' is set (default is nil).

Boolean search snippets enclosed by curly braces are interpreted as
regular expressions that must or (when preceded with \"-\") must not
match in the entry.  Snippets enclosed into double quotes will be taken
as a whole, to include whitespace.

- If the search string starts with an asterisk, search only in headlines.
- If (possibly after the leading star) the search string starts with an
  exclamation mark, this also means to look at TODO entries only, an effect
  that can also be achieved with a prefix argument.
- If (possibly after star and exclamation mark) the search string starts
  with a colon, this will mean that the (non-regexp) snippets of the
  Boolean search must match as full words.

in `org-agenda-text-search-extra-files'.

Return diary information from org files.
This function can be used in a \"sexp\" diary entry in the Emacs calendar.
It accesses org files and extracts information from those files to be

items should be listed.  For a list of arguments allowed here, see the
variable `org-agenda-entry-types'.

The call in the diary file should look like this:

Use a separate line for each org file to check.  Or, if you omit the file name,
all files listed in `org-agenda-files' will be checked automatically:

   &%%(org-diary)

If you don't give any arguments (as in the example above), the default value
of `org-agenda-entry-types' is used: (:deadline :scheduled :timestamp :sexp).
So the example above may also be written as

   &%%(org-diary :deadline :timestamp :sexp :scheduled)

ARGS are symbols indicating what kind of entries to consider.
