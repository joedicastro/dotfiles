* Emacs Configuration using Org-Babel

*This is a work in progress, and is far from being ended*

This repository contains the setup I use to customize Emacs. The
configuration uses [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]], [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org-Babel]] and [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming][Literate Programming]] to
manage all the settings in a unique Org Mode file.

** How it works

It uses one of the standard Emacs init files, =init.el= to bootstrap
all the configuration. This configuration is thought to be stored in
the standard =~/.emacs.d= directory and to setup this configuration
you need to symlink this =emacs= directory to that. Once made that, if
you start Emacs the =~/.emacs.d/init.el= file loads the
=~/emacs.d/readme.org= file into Emacs, and exports all the code
blocks (this process is called "tangling") to
=~/.emacs.d/readme.el=. If a block is marked with =:tangle no= it will
be skipped. When the tangling is finished =readme.el= is loaded to
initialize Emacs.

The cool thing about this setup is that you can export the same file
as documentation to HTML or PDF or LaTeX quite easily, e.g. to do it
from Org mode directly press =C-c C-e=, choose =h= and then one of the
options to produce HTML output. At the same time it makes the
configuration management a delight, been pretty easy to find any
setting and organize them.

* TODO Prerequisites

This is a list of applications that need to be installed previously to
enjoy all the goodies of this configuration.

* Packages setup
** Packages list

The list of packages to install in a fresh installation. The way to
maintain clean and updated this list for me is the following:

- Install a package from the =package.el= built-in interface via =M-x list-packages=
- Test it
  - If seems Ok and I want to use it regularly, add it to the list.
  - If I don't like it, delete the plugin directory in the =~/.emacs.d/elpa= tree.
    I don't care too much about other dependecies that could be also
    installed, I'll get rid of them in the next clean install.

** Repositories

The ELPA repositories from where the packages are fetched.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                             ("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")
                             ("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                             ("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/")))
#+END_SRC

** Auto-installation

The auto-installation process for all the packages that are not
already installed. This is for bootstrap a fresh install.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;;; initialize the packages and create the packages list if not exists
    (package-initialize)
    (when (not package-archive-contents)
      (package-refresh-contents))

    ;;; install packages if not exists
    (dolist (pkg my-packages)
      (when (and (not (package-installed-p pkg))
               (assoc pkg package-archive-contents))
        (package-install pkg)))
#+END_SRC

*** Errors after compling in a fresh installation

   Some packages (e.g. /org-plus-contrib/) can be broken after
   automatic compilation via =package.el=

   To solve this issue we can proceed as follow:

   - Remove all the compiled files (=*.elc=) from the folder
   - Recompile the directory again whith this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE emacs-lisp
    (byte-recompile-directory (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/elpa/org-plug-contrib") 0)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Updating Packages

Requires to do it manually, but is a pretty easy task!

1. execute the command =M-x list-packages= which will automatically refresh the package list
2. press the key =U= to mark all upgradable packages to be upgraded
3. finally press the =x= key to actually perform the new updates

Emacs will then fetch and install all upgrades, and ask you to whether
to remove the old, obsolete versions afterwards.

* General Behaviour

| Binding | Call               | Do                                            |
|---------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| C-w     | backward-kill-word | Kill the entire previous (to the cursor) word |

** Encoding

Make sure that UTF-8 is used everywhere.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (set-language-environment 'utf-8)
    (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (set-input-method nil)
#+END_SRC

** Temporal directory

I like to keep all of the temporal files and dirs (cache, backups,
...) in an unique directory. If this directory does not exists, then
create it

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (unless (file-exists-p "~/.emacs.d/tmp")
        (make-directory "~/.emacs.d/tmp"))
#+END_SRC

** Disable auto-save files

I prefer to use a undo-tree with branches that store auto-save files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq auto-save-default nil)
    (setq auto-save-list-file-prefix nil)
#+END_SRC

** Disable Backups

Because I'm using gpg to authetication and encrypt/sign files, is more
secure don't have a plaint text backup of those files. Use a DVCS and
backup your files regularly, for God's sake!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq make-backup-files nil)
#+END_SRC

** History

Maintain a history of past actions.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq savehist-file "~/.emacs.d/tmp/history")
    (setq-default history-length 1000)
    (savehist-mode t)
    (setq savehist-save-minibuffer-history 1)
    (setq savehist-additional-variables
          '(kill-ring
            search-ring
            regexp-search-ring))
#+END_SRC

** Show matching parenthesis

Show the matching parenthesis when the cursor is above one of them.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq show-paren-delay 0)
    (show-paren-mode t)
#+END_SRC

** Toggle show trailing white-spaces

Show/hide the trailing white-spaces in the buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; from http://stackoverflow.com/a/11701899/634816
    (defun tf-toggle-show-trailing-whitespace ()
      "Toggle show-trailing-whitespace between t and nil"
      (interactive)
      (setq show-trailing-whitespace (not show-trailing-whitespace)))
#+END_SRC

** Always indent with spaces

No more tabs, please, use damn spaces, for God's sake!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
    (setq-default default-tab-width 4)
#+END_SRC

** Replace yes/no questions with y/n

Less keystrokes, I already press enough keys along the day.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+END_SRC

** Mondays are the first day of the week (for M-x calendar)

Set the calendar to my country's calendar standards

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq-default calendar-week-start-day 1)
    (setq calendar-latitude 43.36)
    (setq calendar-longitude 8.38)
    (setq calendar-location-name "A Coruña, Spain")
#+END_SRC

** Use undo-tree for better undo

Emacs's undo system allows you to recover any past state of a buffer
(the standard undo/redo system loses any "redoable" states whenever
you make an edit). However, Emacs's solution, to treat "undo" itself
as just another editing action that can be undone, can be confusing
and difficult to use.

Both the loss of data with standard undo/redo and the confusion of
Emacs' undo stem from trying to treat undo history as a linear
sequence of changes. =undo-tree-mode= instead treats undo history as
what it is: a branching tree of changes (the same system that Vim has
had for some time now). This makes it substantially easier to undo and
redo any change, while preserving the entire history of past states.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'undo-tree)
    (setq undo-tree-visualizer-diff t)
    (setq undo-tree-history-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacs.d/tmp/undo")))
    (setq undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps t)
    (global-undo-tree-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Recent files

Recentf is a minor mode that builds a list of recently opened
files. This list is is automatically saved across Emacs sessions. You
can then access this list through a menu.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'recentf)
    (setq recentf-save-file "~/.emacs.d/tmp/recentf")
    (recentf-mode t)
    (setq recentf-max-saved-items 50)
#+END_SRC

** Keep session between emacs runs (Desktop)

Desktop Save Mode is a feature to save the state of Emacs from one
session to another.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'desktop)
    (setq desktop-path '("~/.emacs.d/tmp/"))
    (setq desktop-dirname "~/.emacs.d/tmp/")
    (setq desktop-base-file-name "emacs-desktop")
    (setq desktop-globals-to-save
          (append '((extended-command-history . 50)
                    (file-name-history . 200)
                    (grep-history . 50)
                    (compile-history . 50)
                    (minibuffer-history . 100)
                    (query-replace-history . 100)
                    (read-expression-history . 100)
                    (regexp-history . 100)
                    (regexp-search-ring . 100)
                    (search-ring . 50)
                    (shell-command-history . 50)
                    tags-file-name
                    register-alist)))

* Vim-like Features

For those who came from Vim is more easy to use something alike

** Use evil

[[https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home][Evil]] is an extensible vi layer for Emacs. It emulates the main
features of Vim, and provides facilities for writing custom
extensions.

trigger an arbitrary number of custom actions.

*** Smex

[[https://github.com/nonsequitur/smex][Smex]] is a M-x enhancement for Emacs. Built on top of IDO, it provides
a convenient interface to your recently and most frequently used
commands. And to all the other commands, too.

| Binding | Call                     | Do                                                           |

| M-x     | smex                     | Calls a interactive command using smex                       |
| M-X     | smex-major-mode-commands | Idem as above but limited to the current major mode commands |

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

**** Useful bindings & Delayed Initation

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I install smex with the following code to make emacs startup a little
faster.  This delays initializing smex until it's needed. IMO, smex
should load without this hack.

Just have smex call =smex-initialize= when it's needed instead of
having the user do it. --[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Smex][LeWang on EmacsWiki]]

*** TODO mu4e

[[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] is an emacs-based e-mail client which uses mu as its back-end

Through mu, mu4e sits on top of your Maildir (which you update with
e.g. offlineimap or fetchmail). mu4e is designed to enable
super-efficient handling of e-mail; searching, reading, replying,
moving, deleting. The overall 'feel' is a bit of a mix of dired and
Wanderlust.

Features include:

 *  Fully search-based: there are no folders, only queries
 *  Fully documented, with example configurations
 *  User-interface optimized for speed, with quick key strokes for common actions
 *  Support for non-English languages (so "angstrom" will match "Ångström")
 *  Asynchronous; heavy actions don't block emacs3
 *  Support for crypto
 *  Writing rich-text e-mails using org-mode
 *  Address auto-completion based on the contacts in your messages - no need for managing address books
 *  Extendable with your own snippets of elisp

The complete process works like this:

+ The email is fetched each ~x~ minutes (via cron) by [[http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/][getmail]]. The mail is fetched from an IMAP account and several POP3 accounts.
+ At the same time the local email (in =localhost=) is fetched by [[http://www.postfix.org/][postfix]] and stored directly in the =Local= folder of the POP3's Maildir.
+ The email that comes from the IMAP account via =getmail= is stored directly in a Maildir directory. In that case I only care about Inbox and Outbox (sent) folders.
+ The email that comes from the several POP3 accounts is processed by [[http://www.procmail.org/][procmail]].
  Various rules filter the emails and stores them in their own sub-directory in the POP3's Maildir.
  The SPAM messages are already checked by my account servers, so I only use the SPAM fields already present to filter them.
  So, is as simple as that:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        ## SPAM

        :0:
        * ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
        Spam/

        :0:
        * ^X-Spam-Flag: YES
        Spam/

        :0:
        * ^X-Spam-Level: \*\*\*\*\*
        Spam/
    #+END_EXAMPLE

  I use a =procmail= rule to send ~notifications~ to the desktop via =notify-sed=. I'm using it for all of them and is like this:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        ## Notification

        :0 ic:
        * ^Subject:.*\/.*
        | echo $MATCH \
        | python2 -c "import email,sys; print email.Header.decode_header(sys.stdin.read())[0][0]" \
        | while read OUTPUT;do notify-send -a 'Tienes un correo nuevo: ' "$OUTPUT";done
    #+END_EXAMPLE

+ Daily, a script, [[https://github.com/joedicastro/cleanup-maildir][cleanup-maildir]], deletes all mails older than 14 days from several folders in the POP3's Maildir.
+ Each two minutes, Emacs orders to [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/][mu]] to index all emails in both Maildirs. *Mu* is the main key of all the configuration.
+ Into Emacs [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] allows us to search & view email. Also we can Reply, Forward an Compose new emails.
  The sensitive user's info is stored in an encrypted file =mail.el.gpg= managed by [[http://epg.sourceforge.jp/][EasyPG (aka EPA)]] and =gpg-agent= (from [[https://www.gnupg.org/][GnuPG]]).
  Also =EasyPG= is used to decrypt encrypted emails and verify signatures in mu4e's View mode.
+ The extension ~maildirs~ is used to summarize the Maildir folders and see how many mails read/unread are in each folder.
+ When a email is composed =mu4e= uses Gnus' message mode to do the task. I use =flyspell-mode= to do a spell check into the message.
  The email address (in fields like To:, Cc:, ...) can be auto-completed using the addresses stored in the emails sent to us and at the same time from the contacts stored in [[https://julien.danjou.info/projects/emacs-packages#org-contacts][org-contacts]]
  [[http://orgmode.org/][Org]] can be used to compose rich-text emails (HTML) easily.
  The emails can be signed & encypted using =EasyPG=.
+ We can attach a file a compose a new email with it directly from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][Dired]]
+ Emacs' =SmtpMail= is used to send emails to the servers. The configuration of the servers is stored in an encrypted file =authinfo.gpg=.
  The emails sent to a POP3 account are stored in the POP3's Maildir Sent folder, the ones sent to the IMAP account are no stored.
  The email can be sent immediately or queued (useful for offline situations). All the queued email is sent at the same time when this feature is turned off.
+ In View mode & Edit mode, if emoticons are present in the message's body, they are rendered as an image.

**** Use encryption

Use encryption to protect the sensitive data like the servers configuration
(stored in =authinfo.gpg=) and the sensitive user's infomation.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'epa-file)
    (epa-file-enable)
    (setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg" "~/.authinfo" "~/.netrc"))
#+END_SRC

**** User information

Sets the default user's information properly.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq user-full-name "joe di castro"
          user-mail-address "joe@joedicastro.com")
#+END_SRC

**** SMTP configuration

This is the default smtp configuration to use with a default account
and allowing to choose between another multiple additional accounts
too.

***** First load the user's sensitive information

This load the =mail.el.gpg= file where I store the email information
that I prefer to keep private (since I share this config in GitHub) to
inquisitive eyes.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'mu4e-main-mode-hook (lambda ()
        (load-library (concat user-emacs-directory "mail.el.gpg"))))
#+END_SRC

Even when I keep this information private, I still going to share with
you the current code stored in that file with make up data.
